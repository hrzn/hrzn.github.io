                </p>
				<p> I work at <a href="http://www.unit8.co">Unit8</a>, on solving impactful data &amp; AI problems for businesses. Previously, I was lead data scientist at Swisscom, where I was in charge of the Swisscom Mobility Insights Platform and the content of the Swisscom Open Data portal. During this time, among other things, I developed key algorithms, models and software that transform billions of data points generated every day by mobile phones into statistics related to mobility, with high accuracy and at the scale of the country.
                    My main technical interests revolve around algorithms (spatial/graph/networks), machine learning, probabilistic models -- and of course I like to write code. 
                    More generally, I enjoy designing solutions with a quantitative edge to relevant problems. I care about projects leaving a positive net impact; I'm especially sensitive to environmental issues.

                <p>
                    I got a PhD from <a href="http://www.epfl.ch">EPFL</a>, with Prof. <a href="http://people.epfl.ch/patrick.thiran">Patrick Thiran</a>.
                    In 2012, I was a visiting researcher at Technicolor in Paris, where I worked on performance prediction for WiFi networks.
                    In 2011, I worked at <a href="http://www.laboratories.telekom.com">Deutsche Telekom T-Labs</a> in Berlin, on the design of efficient and distributed spectrum allocation algorithms for wireless networks.
                    Before that, in 2009, I went to work for my Msc thesis at <a href="http://www.docomoinnovations.com/">Docomo Innovations</a> in Palo Alto, on the design of scalable routing algorithms.

                       <p>
Power-line communications (PLC) are becoming a key component in home networking, because they provide easy and high-throughput connectivity. The dominant MAC protocol for high data-rate PLC, the IEEE 1901, employs a CSMA/CA mechanism similar to the backoff process of 802.11. Existing performance evaluation studies of this protocol assume that the backoff processes of the stations are independent (the so-called decoupling assumption). However, in contrast to 802.11, 1901 stations can change their state after sensing the medium busy, which is regulated by the so-called deferral counter. This mechanism introduces strong coupling between the stations and, as a result, makes existing analyses inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a performance model for 1901, which does not rely on the decoupling assumption. We prove that our model admits a unique solution for a wide range of configurations and confirm the accuracy of the model using simulations. Our results show that we outperform current models based on the decoupling assumption. In addition to evaluating the performance in steady state, we further study the transient dynamics of 1901, which is also affected by the deferral counter.

Power-line communications are employed in home networking to provide easy and high-throughput connectivity. The IEEE 1901, the MAC protocol for power-line networks, employs a CSMA/CA protocol similar to that of 802.11, but is substantially more complex, which probably explains why little is known about its performance. One of the key differences between the two protocols is that whereas 802.11 only reacts upon collisions, 1901 also reacts upon several consecutive transmissions and thus can potentially achieve better performance by avoiding unnecessary collisions. In this paper, we propose a model for the 1901 MAC. Our analysis reveals that the default configuration of 1901 does not fully exploit its potential and that its performance degrades with the number of stations. Based on analytical reasoning, we derive a configuration for the parameters of 1901 that drastically improves throughput and achieves optimal performance without requiring the knowledge of the number of stations in the network. In contrast, 802.11 requires knowing the number of contending stations to provide a similar performance, which is unfeasible for realistic traffic patterns. We confirm our results and enhancement with testbed measurements, by implementing the 1901 MAC protocol on WiFi hardware.

                       <p>
In this dissertation, we consider the problem of assigning spectrum to wireless local-area networks (WLANs). In line with recent IEEE 802.11 amendments and newer hardware capabilities, we consider situations where wireless nodes have the ability to adapt not only their channel center-frequency but also their channel width. This capability brings an important additional degree of freedom, which adds more granularity and potentially enables more efficient spectrum assignments. However, it also comes with new challenges; when consuming a varying amount of spectrum, the nodes should not only seek to reduce interference, but they should also seek to efficiently fill the available spectrum. Furthermore, the performances obtained in practice are especially difficult to predict when nodes employ variable bandwidths. We first propose an algorithm that acts in a decentralized way, with no communication among the neighboring access points (APs). Despite being decentralized, this algorithm is self-organizing and solves an explicit tradeoff between interference mitigation and efficient spectrum usage. In order for the APs to continuously adapt their spectrum to neighboring conditions while using only one network interface, this algorithm relies on a new kind of measurement, during which the APs monitor their surrounding networks for short durations. We implement this algorithm on a testbed and observe drastic performance gains compared to default spectrum assignments, or compared to efficient assignments using a fixed channel width. Next, we propose a procedure to explicitly predict the performance achievable in practice, when nodes operate with arbitrary spectrum configurations, traffic intensities, transmit powers, etc. This problem is notoriously difficult, as it requires capturing several complex interactions that take place at the MAC and PHY layers. Rather than trying to find an explicit model acting at this level of generality, we explore a different point in the design space. Using a limited number of real-world measurements, we use supervised machine-learning techniques to learn implicit performance models. We observe that these models largely outperform other measurement-based models based on SINR, and that they perform well, even when they are used to predict performance in contexts very different from the context prevailing during the initial set of measurements used for learning. We then build a second algorithm that uses the above-mentioned learned models to assign the spectrum. This algorithm is distributed and collaborative, meaning that neighboring APs have to exchange a limited amount of control traffic. It is also utility-optimal -- a feature enabled both by the presence of a model for predicting performance and the ability of APs to collaboratively take decisions. We implement this algorithm on a testbed, and we design a simple scheme that enables neighboring APs to discover themselves and to implement collaboration using their wired backbone network. We observe that it is possible to effectively gear the performance obtained in practice towards different objectives (in terms of efficiency and/or fairness), depending on the utility functions optimized by the nodes. Finally, we study the problem of scheduling packets both in time and frequency domains. Such ways of scheduling packets have been made possible by recent progress in system design, which make it possible to dynamically tune and negotiate the spectrum band used by each frame. We observe that including frequency-domain decisions enables the scheduling algorithms to overcome important inefficiencies that are present in the time domain. In order to achieve these gains, we propose TF-CSMA/CA, a frequency-domain extension of the CSMA/CA backoff mechanism employed by IEEE 802.11. TF-CSMA/CA is completely decentralized, and it requires no explicit signaling, synchronization or spectrum scanning. Yet, we show that it exhibits desirable self-organizing properties in the spectral domain and achieves excellent performance and fairness.

It has recently been shown that ``flexible channelization'', whereby wireless stations adapt their spectrum bands on a per-frame basis, is feasible in practice. In this paper, we propose TF-CSMA/CA, an algorithm for flexible channelization that schedules packets in time and frequency domains. TF-CSMA/CA is a simple extension of the CSMA/CA protocol used by IEEE 802.11. Contrary to existing channelization schemes, it is entirely distributed and it reacts only to packet collisions, successful transmissions and carrier sensing.

With TF-CSMA/CA, when a station is involved in a collision, it performs backoff in both time and frequency domains. Backing off also in the frequency domain allows the transmitters to be much more efficient and aggressive in the time domain, which significantly reduces the severe overheads present with recent 802.11 PHY layers. The main challenge, however, is that the stations need some level of self-organization in order to find spectrum bands of variable widths that minimize interference, while still efficiently using the available spectrum.

Using analysis and simulations, we show that such an extension of CSMA/CA to the frequency domain drastically improves both throughput and fairness. Notably, it enables the stations to find interference-free spectrum bands of appropriate size using no communication -- relying only on collisions and successes as implicit signals.

Accurate prediction of wireless network performance is important when performing link adaptation or resource allocation. However, the complexity of interference interactions at MAC and PHY layers, as well as the vast variety of possible wireless configurations make it notoriously hard to design explicit performance models.

In this paper, we advocate an approach of ``learning by observation'' that can remove the need for designing explicit and complex performance models. We use machine learning techniques to learn implicit performance models, from a limited number of real-world measurements. These models do not require to know the internal mechanics of interfering Wi-Fi links. Yet, our results show that they improve accuracy by at least 49% compared to measurement-seeded models based on SINR. To demonstrate that learned models can be useful in practice, we build a new algorithm that uses such a model as an oracle to jointly allocate spectrum and transmit power. Our algorithm is utility-optimal, distributed, and it produces efficient allocations that significantly improve performance and fairness.

Power-line communications are employed in home networking to provide easy and high-throughput connectivity. IEEE 1901, the MAC protocol for power-line networks, employs a CSMA/CA protocol similar to that of 802.11, but is substantially more complex, which probably explains why little is known about its performance. One of the key differences between the two protocols is that whereas 802.11 only reacts upon collisions, 1901 also reacts upon several consecutive transmissions and thus can potentially achieve better performance by avoiding unnecessary collisions. In this paper, we propose a model for the 1901 MAC. Our analysis reveals that the default configuration of 1901 does not fully exploit its potential and that its performance degrades with the number of stations. We derive analytically the optimal configuration parameters for 1901; this drastically improves throughput and achieves optimal performance without requiring the knowledge of the number of stations in the network. In contrast, to provide a similar performance, 802.11 requires knowing the number of contending stations, which is unfeasible for realistic traffic patterns. Our solution can be readily implemented by vendors, as it only consists in modifying existing MAC parameters. We corroborate our results with testbed measurements, unveiling a significant signaling overhead in 1901 implementations.

Power-line communications are becoming a key component in home networking. The dominant MAC protocol for high data-rate power-line communications, IEEE 1901, employs a CSMA/CA mechanism similar to the backoff process of 802.11. Existing performance evaluation studies of this protocol assume that the backoff processes of the stations are independent (the so-called decoupling assumption). However, in contrast to 802.11, 1901 stations can change their state after sensing the medium busy, which introduces strong coupling between the stations, and, as a result, makes existing analyses inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a new performance model for 1901, which does not rely on the decoupling assumption. We prove that our model admits a unique solution. We confirm the accuracy of our model using both testbed experiments and simulations, and we show that it surpasses current models based on the decoupling assumption. Furthermore, we study the tradeoff between delay and throughput existing with 1901. We show that this protocol can be configured to accommodate different throughput and jitter requirements, and give systematic guidelines for its configuration.

Switzerland has a long tradition of direct democracy, which makes it an ideal laboratory for research on real-world politics.
Similar to recent open government initiatives launched worldwide, the Swiss government regularly releases datasets related to state affairs and politics.
In this paper, we propose an exploratory, data-driven study of the political landscape of Switzerland, in which we use opinions expressed by candidates and citizens on a web platform during the recent Swiss parliamentary elections, together with fine-grained vote results and parliament votes.
</p><p>
Following this purely data-driven approach, we show that it is possible to uncover interesting patterns that would otherwise require both tedious manual analysis and domain knowledge.
In particular, we show that traditional cultural and/or ideological idiosyncrasies can be highlighted and quantified by looking at vote results and pre-election opinions.
We propose a technique for comparing the candidates' opinions expressed before the elections with their actual votes cast in the parliament after the elections.
This technique spots politicians that do not vote consistently with the opinions that they expressed during the campaign.
We also observe that it is possible to predict surprisingly precisely the outcome of nationwide votes, by looking at the outcome in a single, carefully selected municipality.
Our work applies to any country where similar data is available; it points to some of the avenues created by user-generated data emerging from open government initiatives, which enable new data-mining approaches to political and social sciences.

						<p>
We investigate the IEEE 1901 MAC protocol, the dominant
protocol for high data rate power-line communications.
1901 employs a CSMA/CA mechanism similar to – but much
more complex than – the backoff mechanism of 802.11.
Because of this extra complexity, and although this
mechanism is the only widely used MAC layer for
power-line networks, there are few analytical results on
its performance. We propose a model for the 1901 MAC that
comes in the form of a single fixed-point equation for
the collision probability. We prove that this equation
admits a unique solution, and we evaluate the accuracy of
our model by using simulations.

We consider the problem of jointly allocating channel center-frequencies and bandwidths for IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (WLANs). The bandwidth used on a link significantly affects both the capacity experienced on this link and the interference produced on neighboring links. Therefore, when jointly assigning both center frequencies and channel widths, a trade-off must be found between interference mitigation and the potential capacity offered on each link. We study this trade-off and present SAW (spectrum assignment for WLANs), a decentralized algorithm that finds efficient configurations. SAW is tailored for 802.11 home networks. It is distributed, online and transparent. It does not require a central coordinator and it constantly adapts the spectrum usage without disrupting network traffic. The algorithm is decentralized and self-organizing; it provably converges towards efficient spectrum allocations. We evaluate SAW using both simulation and a deployment on an indoor testbed composed of off-the-shelf 802.11 hardware. We observe that it dramatically increases the overall network efficiency and fairness, even when some Access Points (APs) do not behave socially.

					<blockquote>
						<p>
The MAC layer of the IEEE 1901 standard for power line communications employs a CSMA/CA method similar to, but more complex than, this of IEEE 802.11 for wireless communications. The differences between these protocols raise questions such as which one performs better and under what conditions. We study the fairness of the 1901 MAC protocol in single contention domain networks, where all stations hear each other. We examine fairness at the packet level: a MAC layer protocol is fair if all stations share equitably the medium during a fixed time interval. We focus on short-term fairness, that is, over short time intervals. Short-term fairness directly impacts end-user experience, because unfair protocols are susceptible to introduce substantial packet delays. We evaluate short-term fairness with two metrics: Jain's fairness index and the number of inter-transmissions. We present test-bed results of both protocols and compare them with simulations. Both simulation and test-bed results indicate that 802.11 is fairer in the short-term when the number of stations N is between 2 and 5. However, simulation results reveal that 1901 is fairer in the short-term for N >= 15. Importantly, our test-bed measurements indicate that 1901 unfairness can cause significant additional delay when N = 2. Finally, we confirm these results by showing analytically that 1901 is short-term unfair for N = 2.

						<p>
We present PIE, a scalable routing scheme that achieves 100% packet delivery and low path stretch. It is easy to implement in a distributed fashion and works well when costs are associated to links. Scalability is achieved by using virtual coordinates in a space of concise dimensionality, which enables greedy routing based only on local knowledge. PIE is a general routing scheme, meaning that it works on any graph. We focus however on the Internet, where routing scalability is an urgent concern. We show analytically and by using simulation that the scheme scales extremely well on Internet-like graphs. In addition, its geometric nature allows it to react efficiently to topological changes or failures by finding new paths in the network at no cost, yielding better delivery ratios than standard algorithms. The proposed routing scheme needs an amount of memory polylogarithmic in the size of the network and requires only local communication between the nodes. Although each node constructs its coordinates and routes packets locally, the path stretch remains extremely low, even lower than for centralized or less scalable state-of-the-art algorithms: PIE always finds short paths and often enough finds the shortest paths.

						<p>
The goal of jointly providing efficiency and fairness in wireless networks can be seen as the problem of maximizing a given utility function. In contrast with wired networks, the capacity of wireless networks is typically time-varying and not known explicitly. Hence, as the capacity region is impossible to know or measure exactly, existing scheduling schemes either under-estimate it and are too conservative, or they over-estimate it and suffer from congestion collapse. We propose a new adaptive algorithm, called Enhance & Explore (E&E). It maximizes the utility of the network without requiring any explicit characterization of the capacity region. E&E works above the MAC layer and it does not demand any modification to the existing networking stack. We first evaluate our algorithm theoretically and we prove that it converges to a state of optimal utility. We then evaluate the performance of the algorithm in a WLAN setting, using both simulations and real measurements on a testbed composed of IEEE 802.11 wireless routers. Finally, we investigate a wireless mesh network setting and we find that, when coupled with an efficient mechanism for congestion control, the E&E algorithm greatly increases the utility achieved by multi-hop networks as well.

As a result, scheduling and congestion control algorithms are either too conservative because they under-estimate the capacity region, or suffer from congestion collapse because they over-estimate it. We propose a new adaptive congestion control algorithm, called Enhance & Explore (E&E). It maximizes the utility of the network without requiring any explicit characterization of the capacity region.

						<p>
Net-Controller is a user-friendly network visualization and management tool developed at EPFL in order to easily retrieve and display in real time network statistics, such as link throughput and queue occupancy from a large testbed composed of wireless routers. Additionally, Net-Controller allows to control and modify the parameters of a complete network from a central point, and to easily generate traffic between different nodes. We intend to illustrate some of the features of Net-Controller through two examples that show how easily this tool detects and helps elucidate the throughput degradation that occurs in a wireless multi-hop network. The first example shows how and why fair queuing [6] improves performance compared to the standard FIFO policy used in off-the-shelf routers. The second example shows how and why a hop-by-hop congestion control mechanism, such as EZ-Flow [4] is needed to tackle the instability problem of a multi-hop scenario.
